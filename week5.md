## Reflection
 ### Week 5:
  - Front End:
    - Learned using fetch method to communicate with backend
    - Learned React Hook UseEffect to listen the state changed
  - Back end:
    - Learned about CORS
    - Understanding about Json Web Token (JWT)
    - Understading about bcrypt and salt password
  - Sprint 2 presentation

### Challenges Faced:

I haven't faced any challenges until this week. The only issue was an unexpected situation that prevented me from attending class on Wednesday.

### What Went Well and Lessons Learned:

  - Key Learning:
    - Studied more about the fetch method libary, such as Axios
    - Deeply understanding how JWT work, and how to protect password

### Coping Strategies:
 - Academic Progress:
    - Successfully completed all the activities for this week.

  - Soft Skills Development:
    - Improved the presentation skill after Sprint 2

### Project Management:
  - Enhance the feature to connect with backend to get API for frontend

### Final Thoughts:

Looking back on this week's experiences, I'm proud of my efforts in the [Web Course] and [Project Course]. Every challenge presented an opportunity to learn and grow, and I'm excited to continue building my skills and knowledge.

### Next Steps:

[Outline your goals and intentions for the upcoming week, including specific areas you want to focus on.]
